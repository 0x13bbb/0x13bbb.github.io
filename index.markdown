## about
Currently working as a developer. I'm interested in information security, distributed systems, and math, etc. I've worked across industries, e.g. telcos, fintech, and small-businesses in security and software engineering positions starting in 2019.

In the future I'm interested in learning about:
- Rust
- Go
